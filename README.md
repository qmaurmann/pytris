Tetris clone in Python/GTK/Cairo

Over half way to completion. The L, J, and T pieces have been implemented, and basic scoring/row clearing.

A few obvious TODOs:

* Four additional types of pieces (I, S, Z, O)

* Hard drop (space)

* Timer automatically moves the pieces down

* Some resizing to make it look nicer

* Additional points for soft/hard drop?

* General cleanup and documentation, esp of the "abstract" classes
