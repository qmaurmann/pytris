Pytris
======

Tetris clone in Python 2.7.3 using GTK/Cairo (requires GTK 2.0). Tested in Ubuntu 12.04.

Play a game of Tetris by running

    python tetris.py

on the command line. Pieces are controlled with the arrow keys and the space bar (to drop a piece to the bottom row).

The scoring scheme is taken from http://tetris.wikia.com/wiki/Scoring

If the code bears superficial similarity to the code for the Snake game at http://zetcode.com/gui/pygtk/snake/ it is because I used that Snake game as a template for interacting with GTK.

The game is fully functional, though a small amount of "polishing" remains to be done in the following areas:

* Beautifying the GUI

* Cleaning up code

* Improving docstrings
